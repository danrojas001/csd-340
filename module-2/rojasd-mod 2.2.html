    <p class="intro">
        <span class="sentence">My name is Dan Rojas. </span>I live in Omaha. I am enrolled in a software dev course at
        BU.
    </p>
    <p>
        I grew up in LA. The traffic there is much worse than Omaha's. The weather in LA was also much warmer year
        round.
    </p>
    <p>
        My primary hobby was and still is playing video games. I enjoy all kinds but fighting games are probably my
        least
        favorite. My favorite are RPGs.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am geographically distant from all of my family. They all remained on the West Coast. I enjoy the peace and
        quiet.
